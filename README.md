# Text-Summarization




## Overview
Welcome to the End-to-End Text Summarizer repository! This project aims to develop a sophisticated system for generating concise and meaningful text summaries using advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques.

## Key Features

- **Pegasus Model:** Utilizes the state-of-the-art Pegasus model for effective abstractive text summarization.
- **Modular Coding:** Implements a modularized coding structure for enhanced organization and maintainability.
- **Trainer Class:** Leverages the Trainer class from the Hugging Face transformers library for streamlined model training.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Integrates continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for seamless development practices.
- **Web Application:** Expands functionality with a user-friendly web application powered by FastAPI for real-time text summarization predictions.
## Getting Started


### Prerequisites
- Python
- Knowledge in NLP
- Model training

### Installation


    git clone https://github.com/Jerrinthomas007/End-To-End-NLP-Project---Text-Summarization
    cd End-To-End-NLP-Project---Text-Summarization
    pip install -r requirements.
    

### Execution

    python app.py


How open the chrome and run the " localhost:8080 ".
You can train the model from the app itself and also predict after using the app after the successfull completion of training


## Learnings

- Training the model by increasing the no. of epochs can give better and more accurate results.

- Using GPU to train the model will be better where cpu takes lot of time train the model
